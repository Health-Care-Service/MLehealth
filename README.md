# Machine learning on electronic health records

Repository of code developed for TODO: paper title and reference.

## Introduction

The R scripts provided in this repository were developed to perform survival modelling on 100,000 patientsâ€™ electronic health records.

## scripts

### export-bigdata.R

This script was used to export anonymised data for the data-driven modelling with ~600 variables. Its file paths are not correct because they are localised for the secure environment where the raw data are stored.
