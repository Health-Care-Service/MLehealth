#' # Replicating Rapsomaniki _et al._ 2014 without imputation
#' 
#' Rapsomaniki and co-workers' paper creates a Cox hazard model to predict time
#' to death for patients using electronic health record data.
#' 
#' Because such data
#' are gathered as part of routine clinical care, some values may be missing.
#' For example, covariates include blood tests such as creatine level, and use
#' the most recent value no older than six months. A patient may simply not have
#' had this test in that time period.
#' 
#' The approach adopted in this situation, in common with many other similar
#' studies, is to impute missing values. This essentially involves finding
#' patients whose other values are similar to make a best guess at the likely
#' value of a missing datapoint. However, in the case of health records data,
#' the missingness of a value may be informative: the fact that a certain test
#' wasn't ordered could result from a doctor not thinking that test necessary,
#' meaning that its absence carries information.
#' 
#' Whilst there are many approaches which could be employed here, this program
#' represents arguably the simplest: we keep the Cox model as close to the
#' published version as possible but, instead of imputing the missing data, we
#' include it explicitly.
#' 
#' ## User variables
#' 
#' First, define some variables...

#' ## Setup

#+ setup, message=FALSE

require(xtable)
require(ggrepel)

# Load the data and convert to data frame to make column-selecting code in
# prepData simpler
COHORT.full <- data.frame(fread(data.filename))

# Remove the patients we shouldn't include
COHORT.full <-
  COHORT.full[
    # remove negative times to death
    COHORT.full$time_death > 0 &
      # remove patients who should be excluded
      !COHORT.full$exclude
    ,
    ]

# If n.data was specified...

  # Take a subset n.data in size
  COHORT.use <- sample.df(COHORT.full, n.data)
  rm(COHORT.full)
} else {
  # Use all the data
  COHORT.use <- COHORT.full
  rm(COHORT.full)
}

# Redefine n.data just in case we lost any rows
n.data <- nrow(COHORT.use)
# Define indices of test set
test.set <- sample(1:n.data, (1/3)*n.data)

#' OK, we've now got **`r n.data`** patients, split into a training set of
#' `r n.data - length(test.set)` and a test set of `r length(test.set)`.
#'
#'
#' ## Transform variables
#' 
#' The model uses variables which have been standardised in various ways, so
#' let's go through and transform our input variables in the same way...

#' ### Age
#' 
#' Risk of death is a nonlinear function of age at the start of the study, so
#' it is modelled with a cubic spline.

ageSpline <- function(x) {
  max((x-51)/10.289,0)^3 + 
    (69-51) * (max((x-84)/10.289,0)^3) -
    ((84-51) * (max(((x-69))/10.289,0))^3)/(84-69)
}

#' Let's have a look at what that function looks like...

df <- data.frame(
  x = 50:100,
  y = sapply(50:100, ageSpline)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_line()

#' The spline function looks approximately exponential, which makes sense.
#' 
#' ### Other variables
#' 
#' * Most other variables in the model are simply normalised by a factor with an
#'   offset.
#' * Variables which are factors (such as diagnosis) need to make sure that
#'   their first level is the one which was used as the baseline in the paper.
#' * The IMD (social deprivation) score is used by flagging those patients who
#'   are in the bottom quintile.

#' ## Performance
#' 
#' Having fitted the Cox model, how did we do? The c-indices were calculated as
#' part of the bootstrapping, so we just need to take a look at those...
#' 
#' C-indices are **`r round(fit.exp.boot.ests['c.train', 'val'], 3)`
#' (`r round(fit.exp.boot.ests['c.train', 'lower'], 3)` - 
#' `r round(fit.exp.boot.ests['c.train', 'upper'], 3)`)** on the training set and
#' **`r round(fit.exp.boot.ests['c.test', 'val'], 3)`
#' (`r round(fit.exp.boot.ests['c.test', 'lower'], 3)` - 
#' `r round(fit.exp.boot.ests['c.test', 'upper'], 3)`)** on the test set.
#' Not too bad!
#' 
#' 
#' ## Coefficients
#' 
#' As well as getting comparable C-indices, it's also worth checking to see how
#' the risk coefficients calculated compare to those found in the original
#' paper. Let's compare...
