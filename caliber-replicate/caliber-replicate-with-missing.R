#' # Replicating Rapsomaniki _et al._ 2014 without imputation
#' 
#' Rapsomaniki and co-workers' paper creates a Cox hazard model to predict time
#' to death for patients using electronic health record data.
#' 
#' Because such data
#' are gathered as part of routine clinical care, some values may be missing.
#' For example, covariates include blood tests such as creatine level, and use
#' the most recent value no older than six months. A patient may simply not have
#' had this test in that time period.
#' 
#' The approach adopted in this situation, in common with many other similar
#' studies, is to impute missing values. This essentially involves finding
#' patients whose other values are similar to make a best guess at the likely
#' value of a missing datapoint. However, in the case of health records data,
#' the missingness of a value may be informative: the fact that a certain test
#' wasn't ordered could result from a doctor not thinking that test necessary,
#' meaning that its absence carries information.
#' 
#' Whilst there are many approaches which could be employed here, this program
#' represents arguably the simplest: we keep the Cox model as close to the
#' published version as possible but, instead of imputing the missing data, we
#' include it explicitly.
#' 
#' ## User variables
#' 
#' First, define some variables...

#+ define_vars

data.filename <- '../../data/cohort-sanitised.csv'
n.data <- NA # This is of full dataset...further rows may be excluded in prep

output.filename <- '../../output/caliber-replicate-with-missing-try1.csv'

#' ## Setup

#+ setup, message=FALSE

source('../random-forest/shared.R')
require(xtable)
require(ggrepel)

# Load the data and convert to data frame to make column-selecting code in
# prepData simpler
COHORT.full <- data.frame(fread(data.filename))

# Remove the patients we shouldn't include
COHORT.full <-
  COHORT.full[
    # remove negative times to death
    COHORT.full$time_death > 0 &
      # remove patients who should be excluded
      !COHORT.full$exclude
    ,
    ]

# If n.data was specified...
if(!is.na(n.data)){
  # Take a subset n.data in size
  COHORT.use <- sample.df(COHORT.full, n.data)
  rm(COHORT.full)
} else {
  # Use all the data
  COHORT.use <- COHORT.full
  rm(COHORT.full)
}

# Redefine n.data just in case we lost any rows
n.data <- nrow(COHORT.use)
# Define indices of test set
test.set <- sample(1:n.data, (1/3)*n.data)

#' OK, we've now got **`r n.data`** patients, split into a training set of
#' `r n.data - length(test.set)` and a test set of `r length(test.set)`.
#'
#'
#' ## Transform variables
#' 
#' The model uses variables which have been standardised in various ways, so
#' let's go through and transform our input variables in the same way...

#' ### Age
#' 
#' Risk of death is a nonlinear function of age at the start of the study, so
#' it is modelled with a cubic spline.

ageSpline <- function(x) {
  max((x-51)/10.289,0)^3 + 
    (69-51) * (max((x-84)/10.289,0)^3) -
    ((84-51) * (max(((x-69))/10.289,0))^3)/(84-69)
}

#' Let's have a look at what that function looks like...

df <- data.frame(
  x = 50:100,
  y = sapply(50:100, ageSpline)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_line()

#' The spline function looks approximately exponential, which makes sense.
#' 
#' ### Other variables
#' 
#' * Most other variables in the model are simply normalised by a factor with an
#'   offset.
#' * Variables which are factors (such as diagnosis) need to make sure that
#'   their first level is the one which was used as the baseline in the paper.
#' * The IMD (social deprivation) score is used by flagging those patients who
#'   are in the bottom quintile.

#' ## Missing values
#' 
#' To incorporate missing values, we need to do different things depending on
#' the variable type.
#' 
#' * If the variable is a factor, we can simply add an extra factor level
#'   'missing' to account for missing values.
#' * For logical or numerical values, we first make a new column of logicals to
#'   indicate whether the value was missing or not. Those logicals will then
#'   themselves be variables with associated beta values, giving the risk
#'   associated with having a value missing. Then, set the a logical to FALSE or
#'   a numeric to 0, the baseline value, therefore not having any effect on the
#'   final survival curve.

# Specify missing columns - diagnosis only has a handful of missing values so
# sometimes doesn't have missing ones in the sampled training set, meaning
# prepCoxMissing wouldn't fix it.

#' ## Performance
#' 
#' Having fitted the Cox model, how did we do?
#' 

# Calculate C-indices on training and test sets
c.index.train <-
  cIndex(fit.exp, COHORT.scaled[-test.set, ], model.type = 'survreg')

#' **`r round(c.index.test, 3)`** on the test set. Not too bad!
#' 
#' 
#' ## Coefficients
#' 
#' As well as getting comparable C-indices, it's also worth checking to see how
#' the risk coefficients calculated compare to those found in the original
#' paper. Let's compare...

#' ## Strange things about gender
#' 
#' The only huge outlier in this comparison is gender: according to the paper,
#' being a woman is significantly safer than being a man, whereas we
#' don't find a striking difference between genders.
#' 
#' Let's try some simple fits to see if this is explicable.
#' 
#' ### Fit based only on gender

print(
  exp(
    -survreg(
      COHORT.surv.train ~ gender,
      data = COHORT.scaled[-test.set, ],
      dist = "exponential"
    )$coeff
  )
)

#' According to a model based only on gender, women are at higher risk than men.
#' This suggests that there are indeed confounding factors in this dataset.
#' 
#' ### Fit based on age and gender

print(
  exp(
    -survreg(
      COHORT.surv.train ~ age + gender,
      data = COHORT.scaled[-test.set, ],
      dist = "exponential"
    )$coeff
  )
)

#' Once age is taken into account, it is (obviously) more dangerous to be older,
#' and it is once again safer to be female.

ggplot(COHORT.use, aes(x = age, group = gender, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, position = 'dodge', binwidth = 1)

#' And, as we can see from this histogram, this is explained by the fact that
#' the women in this dataset do indeed tend to be older than the men.

print(
  exp(
    -survreg(
      COHORT.surv.train ~ age * gender,
      data = COHORT.scaled[-test.set, ],
      dist = "exponential"
    )$coeff
  )
)

#' Finally, looking at a model where age and gender are allowed to interact, the
#' results are once again a little confusing: being older is worse, which makes
#' sense, but being a woman is again worse. This is then offset by the slightly
#' positive interaction between age and being a woman, meaning that the overall
#' effect of being a slightly older woman will be positive (especially because
#' the spline function gets much larger with advancing age).
#' 
#' It's important to remember that the output of any regression model with many
#' terms gives the strength of a given relationship having already controlled
#' for variation due to those other terms. In this case, even just using two
#' terms can give counter-intuitive results if you try to interpret coefficients
#' in isolation.
#' 
#' ## Coefficients for missing values
#' 
#' Let's see how coefficients for missing values compare to the range of risks
#' implied by the range of values for data...

# Value of creatinine which would result in a 25% increased risk of death
creatinine.25pc.risk <- 60 + 30 * log(1.25)/log(compare.coefficients[

creatinine.missing <- 60 + 30 * 
  log(compare.coefficients[
    compare.coefficients$quantity.level == 'crea_6mo_missingTRUE', 'our_value'
    ]) /
