#' # Replicating Rapsomaniki _et al._ 2014 without imputation
#' 
#' Rapsomaniki and co-workers' paper creates a Cox hazard model to predict time
#' to death for patients using electronic health record data.
#' 
#' Because such data
#' are gathered as part of routine clinical care, some values may be missing.
#' For example, covariates include blood tests such as creatine level, and use
#' the most recent value no older than six months. A patient may simply not have
#' had this test in that time period.
#' 
#' The approach adopted in this situation, in common with many other similar
#' studies, is to impute missing values. This essentially involves finding
#' patients whose other values are similar to make a best guess at the likely
#' value of a missing datapoint. However, in the case of health records data,
#' the missingness of a value may be informative: the fact that a certain test
#' wasn't ordered could result from a doctor not thinking that test necessary,
#' meaning that its absence carries information.
#' 
#' Whilst there are many approaches which could be employed here, this program
#' represents arguably the simplest: we keep the Cox model as close to the
#' published version as possible but, instead of imputing the missing data, we
#' include it explicitly.
#' 
#' ## User variables

#'
#' ## Transform variables
#' 
#' The model uses variables which have been standardised in various ways, so
#' let's go through and transform our input variables in the same way...

#' ### Age
#' 
#' Risk of death is a nonlinear function of age at the start of the study, so
#' it is modelled with a cubic spline.

ageSpline <- function(x) {
  max((x-51)/10.289,0)^3 + 
    (69-51) * (max((x-84)/10.289,0)^3) -
    ((84-51) * (max(((x-69))/10.289,0))^3)/(84-69)
}

#' Let's have a look at what that function looks like...

df <- data.frame(
  x = 50:100,
  y = sapply(50:100, ageSpline)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_line()

#' The spline function looks approximately exponential, which makes sense.
#' 
#' ### Other variables
#' 
#' * Most other variables in the model are simply normalised by a factor with an
#'   offset.
#' * Variables which are factors (such as diagnosis) need to make sure that
#'   their first level is the one which was used as the baseline in the paper.
#' * The IMD (social deprivation) score is used by flagging those patients who
#'   are in the bottom quintile.

#' * For logical or numerical values, we first make a new column of logicals to
#'   indicate whether the value was missing or not. Those logicals will then
#'   themselves be variables with associated beta values, giving the risk
#'   associated with having a value missing. Then, set the a logical to FALSE or
#'   a numeric to 0, the baseline value, therefore not having any effect on the
#'   final survival curve.

# sometimes doesn't have missing ones in the sampled training set, meaning
# prepCoxMissing wouldn't fix it.

#' ## Strange things about gender
#' 
#' The only huge outlier in this comparison is gender: according to the paper,
#' being a woman is significantly safer than being a man, whereas we
#' don't find a striking difference between genders.
#' 
#' Let's try some simple fits to see if this is explicable.
#' 
#' ### Fit based only on gender

print(
  exp(
    -survreg(
      COHORT.surv.train ~ gender,
      data = COHORT.scaled[-test.set, ],
      dist = "exponential"
    )$coeff
  )
)

#' According to a model based only on gender, women are at higher risk than men.
#' This suggests that there are indeed confounding factors in this dataset.
#' 
#' ### Fit based on age and gender

print(
  exp(
    -survreg(
      COHORT.surv.train ~ age + gender,
      data = COHORT.scaled[-test.set, ],
      dist = "exponential"
    )$coeff
  )
)

#' Once age is taken into account, it is (obviously) more dangerous to be older,
#' and it is once again safer to be female.

ggplot(COHORT.use, aes(x = age, group = gender, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8, position = 'dodge', binwidth = 1)

#' And, as we can see from this histogram, this is explained by the fact that
#' the women in this dataset do indeed tend to be older than the men.

print(
  exp(
    -survreg(
      COHORT.surv.train ~ age * gender,
      data = COHORT.scaled[-test.set, ],
      dist = "exponential"
    )$coeff
  )
)

#' Finally, looking at a model where age and gender are allowed to interact, the
#' results are once again a little confusing: being older is worse, which makes
#' sense, but being a woman is again worse. This is then offset by the slightly
#' positive interaction between age and being a woman, meaning that the overall
#' effect of being a slightly older woman will be positive (especially because
#' the spline function gets much larger with advancing age).
#' 
#' It's important to remember that the output of any regression model with many
#' terms gives the strength of a given relationship having already controlled
#' for variation due to those other terms. In this case, even just using two
#' terms can give counter-intuitive results if you try to interpret coefficients
#' in isolation.
#' 
#' ## Coefficients for missing values
#' 
#' Let's see how coefficients for missing values compare to the range of risks
#' implied by the range of values for data...

#' Even an extremely high creatinine reading doesn't confer more than 25%
#' additional risk.

# Value which would result in a 25% increased risk of death

#' Missing HDL values seem to have the opposite effect: it's substantially more
#' risky to have a blank value here. One possible explanation is that this is
#' such a common blood test that its absence indicates that the patient is not
#' seeking or receiving adequate medical care.
#' 
#' ## Systematic analysis of missing values
#' 
#' Clearly the danger (or otherwise) of having missing values differs by
#' variable, according to this model. Let's look at all of the variables, to see
#' how all missing values compare, and whether they make sense.
#'
#+ missing_values_vs_ranges

# Create a column for missing risk, initially empty
cox.var.imp$missing_risk <- NA
# Go through the rows of the data frame, looking for missing value risks...
for(i in 1:nrow(cox.var.imp)) {
  # Does it have a missing value value?
  if(
    paste0(cox.var.imp$quantity[i], '_missingTRUE') %in% 
    compare.coefficients$quantity.level
  ) {
    # If so, add it
    cox.var.imp$missing_risk[i] <-
      compare.coefficients[
        compare.coefficients$quantity.level == 
          paste0(cox.var.imp$quantity[i], '_missingTRUE'),
        'our_value'
        ]
  }
}

# Now, let's draw a graph of those values
ggplot(
  subset(cox.var.imp, !is.na(cox.var.imp$missing_risk)),
  aes(x = quantity, y = missing_risk)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = min_risk, ymax = max_risk))

#' ## Conclusion
#' 
#' That's all folks! Just to confirm that this is reproducible, let's check that
#' our random number generator is lined up as expected after all those
#' calculations. If your seed is the same, you should expect the two random
#' strings to be the same too.
#' 
#' Original random seed: 35498 (found in ``../random-forests/shared.R``);
#' current random seed: `r random.seed`
#' 
#' 
#' Original random string: ``HLIQGMTCWIVJIMXWKUYL``
#' 
#' Current random string: ```r randomString(20, LETTERS)```
